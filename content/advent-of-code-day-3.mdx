Welcome to my coding journey with this year's Advent of Code! As a frontend developer diving into the world of C++, I'm thrilled to share my experiences, learnings, and occasional stumbles. Today, let's explore Day 1's challenge, a seemingly simple task that unfolds into a fascinating problem-solving adventure.

## Part 1: The First Digit Quest

Day 1 started with a straightforward yet intriguing problem. The task was to find the first and last digit on each line of a text document, combine these digits to form a two-digit number, and then sum up these numbers across all lines. For example, "1abc2" translates to 12.

Confident and eager, I jumped right in. The plan was simple: parse the input file, read each line, identify the first digit, and then find the last one. Sounds easy, right?

A key takeaway from this part was converting characters to integers, a process that leverages ASCII values. It's fascinating how such a small detail can be crucial in coding! This might actually sound like one of those "Everybody knows that!" moments, but I'm still a beginner, so I'm allowed to be excited about it ;).

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  std::ifstream file("input.prod");
  std::string line;
  int sum = 0;

  if (file.is_open()) {
    while (getline(file, line)) {
      int firstDigit = '0';
      int lastDigit = '0';

      bool foundFirst = false;

      for (char c : line) {
        if (std::isdigit(c)) {
          firstDigit = c;
          foundFirst = true;
          break;
        }
      }

      if (foundFirst) {
        for (auto it = line.rbegin(); it != line.rend(); it++) {
          if (std::isdigit(*it)) {
            lastDigit = *it;
            break;
          }
        }
      }

      if (foundFirst) {
        int value = (firstDigit - '0') * 10 + (lastDigit - '0');
        sum += value;
      }
    }
    file.close();
  } else {
    std::cout << "Failed to open the input file" << std::endl;
    return -1;
  }

  std::cout << "Total sum: " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Completing Part 1 was a boost to my morale. It felt great to apply C++ in solving real problems, and it was reassuring to see that my strategy worked as intended

## Part 2: The Spelling Challenge

Just when I thought I had it all figured out, Part 2 threw a curveball. Now, the 'digits' could also be words like "one", "two", "three", etc. The task remained the same: form a two-digit number from the first and last 'digits' on each line and sum them up. For instance, "two1nine" becomes 29.

This part was a different beast (at least for me). Parsing spelled-out numbers into digits was a challenge that tested my patience and skills. The process involved creating a function to convert strings to digits, considering both numerals and their word equivalents. After grappling with various issues and spending a considerable amount of time debugging, I finally cracked it. And you know how it feels to solve a problem that has been bugging you for hours.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

// Array of digit representations
const std::string digits[] = { "0",   "1",   "2",     "3",    "4",    "5",   "6",     "7",     "8",   "9", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"};

// Convert string to digit
int64_t to_digit(const std::string &str) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < std::size(digits); ++i) {
    if (str.find(digits[i]) == 0) {
      return (i >= 10) ? i - 9 : i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}

// Main function to process the document
int64_t spelled_out(const std::string &document) {
  int64_t total = 0;
  std::istringstream iss(document);
  std::string line;

  while (std::getline(iss, line)) {
    int64_t first = -1, last = -1;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < line.length(); ++i) {
      for (size_t j = 1; j <= line.length() - i; ++j) {
        int64_t digit = to_digit(line.substr(i, j));
        if (digit != -1) {
          if (first == -1)
            first = digit;
          last = digit;
        }
      }
    }

    if (first != -1 && last != -1) {
      total += first * 10 + last;
    }
  }

  return total;
}

int main() {
  // File input
  std::ifstream file("input.prod");
  if (!file) {
    std::cerr << "Error opening file 'input.txt'" << std::endl;
    return 1;
  }

  std::string document((std::istreambuf_iterator<char>(file)),
                       std::istreambuf_iterator<char>());

  std::cout << "Total: " << spelled_out(document) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In conclusion, day 1 of the Advent of Code was a blend of simplicity and complexity, comfort and challenge. It was a perfect start to my C++ journey, teaching me not just about the language but also about the nuances of problem-solving in programming. Every line of code was a step forward in my learning path.
