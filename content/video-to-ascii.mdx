## Introduction

In this guide, we'll explore how to transform a video into mesmerizing ASCII art using OpenCV and C++. ASCII art is a creative way to represent images through text characters. We'll take you through the process of setting up the project, building it, and running it on macOS.

With that said, let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of C++ programming.
- OpenCV installed on your system.

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Install OpenCV and Set Up the Environment

- Ensure that OpenCV is installed on your macOS. If not, you can install it using a package manager like Homebrew:
  ```shell
  $ chmod +x build.sh
  ```
  Make sure you have Homebrew installed. If not, you can find installation instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

### Step 2: Configure the Project

- Open the provided C++ code (main.cpp) in your preferred code editor.

### Step 3: Edit compile_commands.json (For VIM Users)

- If you are using Vim, locate the `compile_commands.json` file in your project directory.
- Find the path to your OpenCV installation and update it in the `compile_commands.json` file.

### Step 4: Modify Paths in build.sh

- Open the `build.sh` script.
- Update the path to your OpenCV installation.
- Update the path to OpenCV libraries in the script.

### Step 5: Make build.sh Executable

- Give execution permission to the `build.sh` script:

```shell
$ chmod +x build.sh
```

### Step 6: Build the Project

- Run the following command in your terminal to build the project:

```shell
$ chmod +x build.sh
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Edit the Video Path

- Open the `main.cpp` file in your code editor.
- Locate the line with the comment: "Edit the path of video in main.cpp".
- Replace `"./video.mp4"` with the path to your video file.

### Step 2: Run the Project

- In your terminal, execute the following command to run the project:

```shell
$ chmod +x build.sh
```

## Explanation

- The code reads the video specified in `main.cpp`.
- It converts each frame of the video to grayscale and resizes it to fit the desired ASCII art dimensions.
- ASCII art is generated from the pixel intensity of each resized frame.
- The resulting ASCII art is displayed in the terminal in real-time.

## Tips

- You can experiment with different video files to create unique ASCII art.
- Adjust the `width` and `height` variables in `main.cpp` to change the size of the ASCII art.
- The `pixelToASCII` function in the code maps pixel intensity to ASCII characters. You can modify this mapping to achieve different visual effects.

Congratulations! You've successfully set up and run a project that transforms videos into captivating ASCII art using OpenCV and C++. Explore the world of ASCII art and unleash your creativity. Enjoy the mesmerizing results!
