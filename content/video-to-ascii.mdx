## Introduction

In this technical essay, we will explore a fascinating project that involves transforming videos into ASCII art using C++ and OpenCV. By leveraging the power of OpenCV's computer vision library and the versatility of the C++ programming language, we can create a program that converts video frames into a visually appealing ASCII representation.

## Features

The program offers the following features:

- Real-time video processing: The program processes video frames in real-time, enabling users to see the ASCII art representation as the video plays.
- Dynamic resizing: The program automatically resizes the video frames to fit a specified width and height while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- Customizable ASCII character set: The program utilizes a predefined set of ASCII characters to represent different intensities of pixels, resulting in visually pleasing ASCII art.
- Cross-platform compatibility: The program is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Dependencies

In order to build and run the program, you will need the following dependencies:

- OpenCV: Install the OpenCV library, which provides the necessary functions for video processing and image manipulation.
- C++ compiler: Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as GCC or Clang.
- Homebrew (macOS only): Ensure you have Homebrew installed in your macOS machine so you can install OpenCV with it.

## Building and Running (macOS)

### Clone the repository

First of all you will have to clone this [repository](https://github.com/jmartinn/vid-to-ascii) like so:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jmartinn/vid-to-ascii.git
```

### Install OpenCV

- Install OpenCV by running:

```shell
brew install opencv
```

> Refer to the OpenCV [documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/) for detailed instructions based on your operating system.

### Modify the `compile_commands.json` file:

- If you are a real chad and you are using vim or neovim as your editor, locate the `compile_commands.json` file in your project directory.
- Find the path of the OpenCV library in your system and replace it with the corresponding path in the `compile_commands.json` file.

  Assuming you are on macOS when you install OpenCV and its libraries the path is always the same except for the version, so in case you have a different version that me just replace the version.

  ```shell
  g++ -std=c++11 -I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv/<your_version>/include/opencv4 -L/opt/homebrew/opt/opencv/lib -lopencv_gapi -lopencv_stitching -lopencv_alphamat -lopencv_aruco -lopencv_barcode -lopencv_bgsegm -lopencv_bioinspired -lopencv_ccalib -lopencv_dnn_objdetect -lopencv_dnn_superres -lopencv_dpm -lopencv_face -lopencv_freetype -lopencv_fuzzy -lopencv_hfs -lopencv_img_hash -lopencv_intensity_transform -lopencv_line_descriptor -lopencv_mcc -lopencv_quality -lopencv_rapid -lopencv_reg -lopencv_rgbd -lopencv_saliency -lopencv_sfm -lopencv_stereo -lopencv_structured_light -lopencv_phase_unwrapping -lopencv_superres -lopencv_optflow -lopencv_surface_matching -lopencv_tracking -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_datasets -lopencv_text -lopencv_plot -lopencv_videostab -lopencv_videoio -lopencv_viz -lopencv_wechat_qrcode -lopencv_xfeatures2d -lopencv_shape -lopencv_ml -lopencv_ximgproc -lopencv_video -lopencv_xobjdetect -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_imgcodecs -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_dnn -lopencv_flann -lopencv_xphoto -lopencv_photo -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_core -o exe main.cpp
  ```

- Also update both `path` and `directory` keys to match your project path and your `main.cpp` file respectively.
- This step ensures that the compiler can find the necessary OpenCV headers during the build process.

### Edit the opencv path in `build.sh`:

- Open the file
- Modify the opencv path to match the location of the OpenCV libraries on your system just as we did in the previous step with the `compile_commands.json` file.

> You can always use `brew info` command followed by _opencv_ to get the information needed to get the paths we discused earlier.

### Edit the video path in `main.cpp`:

- Replace the _**video.mp4**_ with the actual path of the video you want to convert into ASCII art.

```C++
string video_path = "./video.mp4";
```

### Grant permission to `build.sh`:

- Open the terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to grant execute permission to the `build.sh` script:

```shell
$ chmod +x build.sh
```

### Let the magic happen!

Run the following command and enjoy:

```shell
$ ./build.sh
```

### Conclusion

In this article, we explored the process of transforming videos into ASCII art using C++ and OpenCV. By following the steps mentioned above, you can build and run the program successfully. With its real-time video processing, dynamic resizing, customizable ASCII character set, and cross-platform compatibility, the program offers a unique and engaging way to experience videos in a creative manner. So go ahead, unleash your creativity, and witness the captivating world of video-to-ASCII art transformation.
